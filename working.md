Cool, you're working on something.

*Why?* okay, and why? and why is *that* important? Keep digging. Beyond "interesting," know what it is that makes what you're doing valuable/exciting before you get too deep ðŸŒŠ

Who else is doing similar work? and where are they?
- ask questions as you go--on Twitter, Github, Discord--wherever the action is 
- tag people you think may be aligned with you & your work
- ask friends for feedback (but don't wait for feedback to continue!)
- write short, simple articles about what you're doing, tweet out excerpts
